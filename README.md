- 👋 Hi, I’m @nick-sweeten

<!--
- 👀 I’m interested in...
      Well... a variety of things.  Im interested in tech and science, electrical engineering, computer science and the internet...
      ... statistics and data... but most of all, Im passionate about mathematics.
      I prefer to code in Python, though I have dabbled in a fairly wide variety of languages.  Ive done everything from Batch and Bash scripting, to 
      XHTML/CSS/JavaScript web designing. I started out with Basic/QBasic and ended up with Arduinos and Assembly on microcontrollers.  I love me my
      Excel spreadsheets and scripting macros, and my mathematics career has taken me through MATLAB, R, Mathematica, Maxima, and other CAS languages.
      Ive used MySQL and Ajax on the web.
      I dont consider myself an expert at any of these languages, but Im getting decent at Python, where my focuse has been primarily in mathematics.
      With some connections to electronics; but I will explain that.
      I dont aim to market any products or innovate any novel new tools with my coding; what I do is mostly academic and for my own edification.  
      As an electrical engineer and mathematician Im fascinated by computation, and in particular computation within digital computers.
      Most CS majors - which Im not one - can explain how binary addition and subtraction work. They may even be able to explain the format for a floating
      point number. Few Ive crossed have been able to explain efficient integer multiplication, or floating point arithmetic. Much less how logarithms or
      trigonometric functions are calculated. All sort of hand-wavy to them. Oh sure, they can import a mathematics package, but whats under the hood of
      that package is anyones guess to them.
      My scripts are explorations of calculation. I try to recreate the code that someone, somewhere, deep down in the hearts of computers, had already
      programmed; the sort of code that no one programming web applications or advanced windows GUIs have any care to know.
      My programs arent just transcendental functions that are typically programmed algorithmetically into a computer, but they also include, to some
      limited capacity, simulations of hardware computation, such as what goes on in an ALU.
      I write my own mathematics functions. Granted, they may not be as fast due to it being Python, or perhaps I have more to learn in the way of efficiency
      or time complexity. But I write them. And they work. And they're beautiful. They're beautiful examples of computational genius that I lack the
      imagination to have ever innovated. Im documenting them. Im rediscovering them.  Im learning to understand them. In a way most people in our age, no
      matter their CS genius, probably dont, because its "beneath them" in difficulty and necessity. And neither do mathematicians know, to be frank,
      because CS is outside of their purview too.  If mathematicians care about the abstract and the results of calculation, rather than the processes 
      within digital computers, and computer scientists care about high level hardware, GUI, web, etc., and not the "little things", then who does
      know and learn and record these niche details, the foundations upon which everything else is necessarily based?
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
      Most recently Ive began learning about randon number generation, cryptography, and prime number testing.
      Im particularly proud of my prime number algorithm.  I employ multiple different techniques and believe my algorithm is fairly efficient and quite
      accurate.  I believe my results are more certain than most algorithms in common use today.  Ignoring the burdens and relative slowness of Python,
      I can generate pretty large prime numbers (2048-bit, or larger) in very little time, all things considered. With many orders of magnitude more certainty.
      With cryptography, Ive coded my own RSA, Diffie-Hellman and Shamir's Secret Sharing, among other functions.
      With regard to random number generation, Ive done all the usual PRNG methods from middle square to linear congruence to xorshift, and dozens of others,
      as well as various combinations of them to improve randomness and cycle length. Ive even collected data from the environment to integrate into the
      number generators.  Ive programmed randomness quality checkers, ensured uniformity in output, and produced all the common continuous floating point
      distributions, from the uniform linear to the Normal to the Chi-Square.

      Well, you tell me.  Im not the best coder out there. And my interests are pretty clear.
